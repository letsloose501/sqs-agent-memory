description: Lint, validate and security-scan Agent Skills. Use when asked to check or audit a SKILL.md; when a skill does not fire, fires on a neighbour's work, or half-works and silently skips steps; when writing or reworking one; after a rename left a reference pointing at nothing; before committing or publishing; when a skill came from elsewhere and has to be read before it is trusted; when deciding which skill to write or fix next from the work actually done; and when the question is whether the last edit made its routing better or worse.

# Skill quality suite

Validates a `SKILL.md` against the Agent Skills specification, lints the instructions an
agent will actually follow, scans a skill for secrets and prompt injection before you
install it, checks whether it will work on another agent, and measures whether it
improves the agent's work at all.

A quality gate in two halves. The **static** half reads the skill: eight checks,
one command each, separate because they fail at different moments - structure
breaks today and in silence, the specification breaks on publication, compatibility
breaks on somebody else's machine, routing breaks when a neighbour's description moves.
Running them as one undifferentiated pass reports all four with the same urgency, which
is how a report stops being read.

The **evaluation** half runs an agent: does the skill fire, does it make the work come
out better, did the last edit make it worse. It costs money and minutes and needs an
agent installed, so nothing in it runs unless you ask for it by name.

Everything lives in `scripts/sqs.py`. The static half is standard library only and works
offline; it finds the skills folder on its own, or takes `--skills-dir`.

## Paid layers: offer, warn, never start

`sqs.py eval` in every form, and any check a model has to read or judge, spends the
user's money or the usage window of their subscription. The rule for all of it:

1. **Never run a paid layer on your own initiative**, however well it fits the task. Run
   it only after the user said yes to that run in this conversation.
2. **When a paid layer would help, offer it - and say, every time, that it is paid** and
   what one run costs: a capped trigger run measured at about $0.21 (23.09.2026); a
   trigger set of twenty queries at three runs each is sixty of those.
3. **Say that it pays off only over time.** One run of a model that answers differently
   each time is an anecdote. The value is a measurement repeated across edits - the
   regression gate comparing this version with the last one - not a single number today.
4. **Offer the free step first**: `check`, `route --prompt`, `evals`, `cases
   --from-history`. Most "does it fire" questions are answered there.

Plain wording that works: "This would need `eval --trigger`, which is paid - about $0.21
per run, sixty runs for a proper set - and only pays off if you keep measuring across
edits. The free checks say X. Run it?"

## Start here

| The situation | Run |
|---|---|
| Just edited a skill, want it intact | `sqs.py check <skill>` |
| A skill does not fire, or half-works | `sqs.py check <skill>` and `sqs.py route --prompt "..."`; `eval --trigger` is **paid - ask first** |
| Does the skill actually help | `sqs.py eval <skill> --runtime` - **paid, ask first**: the task with it and without it |
| Did my last edit break it | `sqs.py eval <skill> --all --save v2`, then `--compare v1 v2` - **paid, ask first** |
| What do people actually type to reach it | `sqs.py cases <skill> --from-history` - free, reads local transcripts |
| What should I change in this skill | `sqs.py improve <skill>` - findings with fixes, your requests, your [mistakes journal](references/mistakes-journal.md) |
| Which skill to write next, or which one keeps missing | `sqs.py discover` - free, reads local transcripts; then propose from [from-history.md](references/from-history.md) |
| Switching the gate on over an old tree | `sqs.py baseline create`, then `check --baseline` |
| One line per layer, for a decision | `sqs.py check <skill> --format board` |
| Writing a new skill | `sqs.py new <name> [--seed WORD]`, then [creating-a-skill.md](references/creating-a-skill.md) |
| Reworking a skill that grew unwieldy | `sqs.py check <skill>`, then the reading pass in [writing-rubric.md](references/writing-rubric.md) |
| A skill arrived from elsewhere | `sqs.py security <skill>` **before** running it, then `check` |
| About to commit or publish | `sqs.py all <skill> --strict`, then [publishing.md](references/publishing.md) |
| Renamed something | `sqs.py structure` - it catches the pointers the rename orphaned |
| Sweeping the whole tree | `sqs.py check --quiet` |
| Will it work anywhere but this machine | `sqs.py compat <skill> --harness all` |
| Port it to another harness | `sqs.py compat <skill> --harness <target>`, then [porting.md](references/porting.md) - read the target's page first |

`check` is the everyday one: structure, spec, quality, compat and security together.
`all` adds the publish module. Neither runs an agent - that is `eval`, and it is always
opt-in.

## From your history to a proposal

`sqs.py discover` reads which skills' scripts ran while they never loaded, and which work
repeats with no skill at all; it prints evidence and decides nothing. Turning it into a
proposal - read the prompts, group, propose, wait for a yes - is in
[from-history.md](references/from-history.md).

## Reading the report

```
⛔ SP004  `name: video-tools` does not match the folder `video` (SKILL.md)
⚠️  ST006  SKILL.md is 21370 B > the 15000 B budget (SKILL.md)
·   QL006  при необходимости - lines 191, 295 (SKILL.md:191)
```

- **⛔ error** - fix it. Nothing here is cosmetic: a broken pointer into `references/`
  does not crash anything, the agent just skips the step in silence, and from outside it
  looks like the work came out weaker than usual. That is why this class of breakage
  survives for months.
- **⚠️ warning** - a decision, not a defect. An orphan file is either unwired or no
  longer needed, and only you know which.
- **· info** - a nudge. Real, small, and safe to leave.

`--format board` prints one line per layer instead of a finding list - the view for
deciding rather than fixing, where a layer nobody ran says `NOT RUN` instead of looking
like a pass. `--score` adds an aggregate number and the arithmetic that produced it:
additional, never the headline, because a number hides which question failed. `sarif`
feeds GitHub code scanning, `github` annotates a diff, `json` everything else.

Every finding carries a rule code. `sqs.py explain ST008` gives the code's reasoning and
its fix; `sqs.py rules` lists all of them. Reach for `explain` rather than guessing at
what a message means - the reasoning is the part that decides whether the finding
applies to your case.

## The modules

```
sqs.py structure   links, orphans, budgets, section pointers, outbound paths
sqs.py spec        layout, fences, description shape, asset weight, nesting
sqs.py quality     the description as a pointer, placeholders, vague bounds
sqs.py compat      will the skill work on somebody else's harness
sqs.py security    secrets, destructive commands, injection, hidden characters
sqs.py evals       the eval files and the routing invariants - free
sqs.py publish     what has to be true before the skill leaves the machine
sqs.py fix         the repairs with exactly one correct answer
sqs.py eval        runs the agent: triggering, task success, regressions - costs money
sqs.py baseline    the findings a tree has agreed to live with, for now
```

`evals` reads the eval files and costs nothing. `eval` runs the agent and costs money.
The two are one letter apart because they are about the same thing at two prices.

Four of them need a word of their own.

**`security`** is the one to run on a skill somebody else wrote, *before* the agent reads
it for work. A skill is executable text; an installed skill is a supply chain. It reports
credentials, destructive commands, text addressed at the agent rather than the task, and
hidden or bidirectional characters that make the rendered file differ from the file the
model reads.

**`compat`** is the check your own machine can never make for you. It reads the skill
as a list of features - a frontmatter field, a directory, a tool name, a hard-coded
path into someone's skill folder - and asks ten harness adapters what each one means
to them: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Cline, Roo
Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot. Every row rests on that project's own documentation,
and what the documentation does not state comes back `UNKNOWN` rather than as an
invented incompatibility. `sqs.py harnesses` lists them with the page each rests on.

**`evals`** is the free half of testing. Per skill: does this one carry a usable eval
set (`evals/trigger/*.yaml` or `evals/eval_queries.json`, and `evals/evals.json`;
`--init` scaffolds them). Tree-wide: do the routing invariants still hold, delegated to
`evals/run_evals.py` when one sits beside the skills.

**`eval`** is the half that runs an agent, and the only part of the suite that observes
behaviour instead of reasoning about text:

- `--trigger` sends each query to a headless session and counts what loaded. The output
  is the confusion matrix - true and false positives and negatives, precision, recall,
  F1 - printed beside the cases it came from. F1 is **printed, not scored**: it weighs a
  miss and a false fire equally, and in a tree of skills they are not equal.
- `--runtime` runs the task set twice, once with the skill loaded and once with no
  skills at all, and reports task success, tool calls, turns, time, tokens, cost and
  whether following the skill made the agent do something destructive. A task with no
  assertions comes back `ungraded`, never as a pass.
- `--save <label>` stores a run; `--compare v1 v2` diffs two. Quality falling fails the
  gate, cost rising is reported and does not, because cheaper-and-worse and
  dearer-and-better are both trades somebody has to look at.

`sqs.py eval <skill>` with no layer named runs nothing: it prints what each layer would
cost and stops. See [evaluating.md](references/evaluating.md).

**`fix`** is a dry run unless you pass `--apply`. It only repairs what the broken state
forces: the name the folder already dictates, characters that should never have been in
the file. It deliberately will not shorten an over-long description - there is no single
right shortening, and picking one for you deletes a trigger you needed.

## Fixing what it found

1. `sqs.py explain <CODE>` - the reasoning, then the fix.
2. `sqs.py fix --apply` for the mechanical ones.
3. The rest by hand. When the finding is about **what the skill says** rather than how it
   is wired, the report has taken you as far as counting can: open
   [writing-rubric.md](references/writing-rubric.md) and do the reading pass.
4. Re-run until clean. A run that ends `0 error` and a run you assumed would are
   different things.

Three scopes of escape hatch, for findings that are correct-and-intended:

- **A line** - write `sqs-allow: SE002` on it or just above it. This is how one
  quotation of a dangerous pattern avoids being reported as a use of one.
- **A file** - `sqs-allow-file: SE001, SE002` in its first 25 lines, for a file whose
  whole job is to hold the patterns. Annotating each occurrence there would be noise
  pretending to be care.
- **The tree** - `sqs.config.json` beside the skills: `rules` maps a code to
  `off`/`info`/`warning`/`error`, `ignore` skips skills, `allow_dirs` accepts a directory
  the spec does not name, `harnesses` sets the target environments and `lang` the
  publication language.
- **A subtree** - `.sqsignore` at the skill root, one path glob per line: not read at all,
  so nothing is claimed about it. It hides a path from this suite only, not from the
  installer (`PB015`).

Two more ways to make a report survive contact with an old tree, neither of which hides
anything:

- `--baseline` reports only what the baseline file does not already carry, so switching
  the gate on over three hundred existing findings does not turn the build red on day
  one. The recorded findings stay in the file, dated, and `sqs.py baseline show` lists
  them: it is a queue, not a bin.
- `--min-confidence high` drops the findings the suite is less sure of - the prose
  heuristics - and keeps the filesystem and parse facts. Every rule carries a detection
  confidence and a false-positive risk, and `sqs.py explain <CODE>` prints both.

Record *why* in the config next to the entry. A silenced rule with no reason gets
un-silenced by the next person who reads the file, including you.

## Editing this suite

Changing a rule, a harness or the evaluation layer of this suite itself: read
[editing-this-suite.md](references/editing-this-suite.md) first - the audit, the
golden corpus and the generated pages all have to agree before a change is done.

## The references

- [creating-a-skill.md](references/creating-a-skill.md) - the order for building a new
  skill, and for reworking an old one. Open it before writing any skill from scratch.
- [writing-rubric.md](references/writing-rubric.md) - the reading pass: the pointer, the
  two loads, the information hierarchy, completion criteria, leading words, pruning. Open
  it when the problem is what the skill says rather than how it is wired.
- [agent-compatibility.md](references/agent-compatibility.md) - the ten harnesses, what
  each row rests on, the five portability verdicts, and how to add a harness without
  inventing one. Open it before answering "will this work on X".
- [evaluating.md](references/evaluating.md) - the three eval questions, the trigger loop
  with its train/validation split, the baseline/treatment comparison, the regression
  gate, and the part that stays a human's job. Open it before touching a description
  that already fires, and before the first `sqs.py eval`.
- [publishing.md](references/publishing.md) - the gate before a skill leaves the machine,
  and what the publish module cannot see.
- [from-history.md](references/from-history.md) - from the user's own sessions to a
  proposal: which skill to write next, which one keeps missing. Open it before `discover`.
- [mistakes-journal.md](references/mistakes-journal.md) - recording a mistake, reviewing
  the journal into rules and gates, and what `improve` reads from it.
- [porting.md](references/porting.md) - moving a skill to another harness: read the
  target's own page now, plan against it, write a copy, never the original. Open it before
  changing a skill for a harness it was not written for.
- [editing-this-suite.md](references/editing-this-suite.md) - the audit, the golden
  corpus and the generated pages. Open it before changing a rule, a harness or the
  evaluation layer of this suite itself.
