    sqs.py route --prompt "..."      which skill this wording resembles, offline

The modules are separate because they fail at different moments. Structure breaks
today, silently. Spec breaks on publication. Compat breaks on somebody else's machine.
Evals break when a neighbouring description moves. Running them as one pass would
report all four with the same urgency, which is how a report stops being read.

Output: `--format text` (default), `json`, or `github` for CI annotations.
Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 findings that count as failures · 2 usage error.

A line carrying `sqs-allow: SE002` (or `sqs-allow: *`) is exempt from that code - the
escape hatch for a file that documents a pattern rather than using it.
