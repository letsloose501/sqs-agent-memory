"""The rule registry: one row per finding the suite can emit.

A rule code is the join key of the whole suite. `sqs.py explain ST005` looks a code
up here, a config file switches a code off here, CI annotations group by it, and the
report prints it. That only works while this file is the single place a code is
defined - an engine that invents a code without a row here fails `sqs.py rules
--audit`, which is what keeps the two from drifting.

Severity here is the DEFAULT. The structure engine (check_skills.py) decides error vs
warning itself, because it knows the case; everything else takes the default, and a
config file overrides either.

Modules map one-to-one onto code prefixes, so a finding routes to its module without
a lookup:

    SP  spec        Agent Skills specification conformance
    ST  structure   links, orphans, budgets, layout
    QL  quality     whether the instructions read like instructions
    CP  compat      which runtime reads which frontmatter field
    SE  security    secrets, dangerous commands, injection, hidden characters
    PB  publish     what has to be true before the skill leaves your machine
    EV  evals       whether the skill fires on the wording a human actually uses
    CB  capabilities what a bundled script CAN do to the machine, described not forbidden

sqs-allow-file: SE002
Every rule row spells out the pattern it is about, so this file matches its own
security rules by construction.

# ---- rule metadata ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two gradings per rule, and they answer different questions:
#
#   confidence      does the check reliably find the thing it names? A filesystem
#                   fact or a parse is `high`; a regex over prose is `medium`; a
#                   similarity heuristic is `low`.
#   false_positive  when the thing IS there, how often is it nonetheless intended?
#                   `README.md` inside a skill folder is a finding and also exactly
#                   what a repository-shaped skill does, so SP013 is `high`.
#
# Both are about the mechanism, not about how much the finding matters - severity
# already carries that. They exist so a report can be filtered by how much a machine
# should be trusted with the judgement: `--min-confidence high` is a gate you can
# leave on in CI, and a `high` false-positive rule is one to read before believing.
#
# A code with no row here fails `sqs.py rules --audit`. `unrated` is the honest value
# for a rule whose engine has not been written yet, and it is not the same as `high`.
