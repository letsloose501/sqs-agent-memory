# Evaluating a skill

Three different questions, often confused, measured separately:

1. **Does it fire?** The description is the whole triggering mechanism. A skill that
   never activates is worth nothing, however good its instructions.
2. **Does it help?** The same task, run with the skill and with no skill at all. A skill
   that changes nothing is load the agent pays for and gets nothing back.
3. **Did the last edit make it worse?** Two stored runs, diffed. Without this, every
   description change is a guess with a good feeling attached.

All three assume a case set exists, and writing one is the step people skip - a stranger's
skill arrives with none at all. [Where the cases come from](#where-the-cases-come-from) is
the three sources to build it from, including the question none of the three above asks:
does the skill do what it says it does?

The first two follow the official skill-creation guidance:
[optimizing-descriptions](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions),
[evaluating-skills](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills).

Everything on this page **runs an agent**, so it costs money and minutes and needs one
installed. The rest of the suite is offline, deterministic and dependency-free; nothing
here runs unless you name it.

```

`sqs.py evals <skill> --init` writes the skeletons. `sqs.py evals <skill>` checks that
they parse and that the trigger set is not lopsided; neither costs anything.

## The commands

```
sqs.py eval ./my-skill                     what it would run, and what it would cost
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --trigger           does it fire, and only when it should
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --runtime           the task set, with the skill and without
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --all --save v1     both, stored under a label
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --compare v1 v2     what the last edit moved
```

`evals/environment.json` holds named settings - `{"environments": {"default":
{"provider": "claude", "model": "...", "runs": 3}}}` - and `--env NAME` picks one; without
it `default` is used if present. A flag on the command line wins over the file. Each saved
run records its settings, and `--compare` says so when two runs differ in them: what
moved may be the model, not the skill. An unknown key is refused, not guessed.

`eval` with no layer named runs nothing: it prints how many agent runs each layer would
take and stops. A command that spends money on the strength of a typo is a command
people stop trusting.

## 1. Does it fire

```
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --trigger --runs 5
```

It sends each query to a headless session and watches whether the skill was loaded.
That is a harder question than any description-reading check answers: a judge asked
"where would this wording route" is reasoning about the description, while this
observes the activation.

### Writing the queries

```yaml
# evals/trigger/should-trigger.yaml
- prompt: "Log this receipt: 12.40 EUR at Bakery Nord"
  expected: trigger
```

One item per `prompt`, with an optional `expected` that restates the file's own label.
The parser reads that shape and refuses everything else - nesting, block scalars, flow
collections - by name and line number. A tolerant parser would be a liability here:
silently misreading a label turns a should-not-trigger case into a should-trigger one,
and the report would then call a precision failure a success.

About twenty queries, eight to ten on each side. Vary phrasing, explicitness, detail
and number of steps; include casual wording, file paths, a bit of backstory, the odd
typo. Real prompts carry context that invented test strings do not.

- **The useful positives** are the ones where the skill would help and the query does
  not say so. If the query already asks for exactly what the skill does, any description
  triggers and the case measures nothing.
- **The useful negatives are near-misses** - queries sharing vocabulary with the skill
  that need something else. "Write a fibonacci function" against a CSV skill tests
  nothing. "Write a script that reads a CSV and uploads each row to postgres" does: it
  is full of CSV and is not analysis.

`EV005` reports a set that is thin on either side, because a set with few negatives
measures breadth and cannot tell you the description got greedy.

### Reading the result

The model is not deterministic, so each query runs several times and what is measured
is a **trigger rate**. Above 0.5 counts as "it fires". From that come the four counts
and the three ratios:

```
    fired when it should        9   (recall    90%)
    stayed quiet when it should 8
    missed                      1   (precision 82%)
    barged in                   2   (F1        86%)
```

**F1 is printed, not scored.** It weighs a miss and a false fire equally, and they are
not equal: a skill that stays quiet costs a turn, a skill that barges in costs the user
their work. Which one your tree can afford is a judgement about your tree, not a
property of the number. The cases are printed under the counts for the same reason -
two false positives that are both the same near-miss are one problem, and only the list
shows that.

Under a missed should-trigger case the report says **what loaded instead** - the first
skill each run reached for, or nothing:

```
      [0.00] did not fire: archive receipt number 2 from march
             went to: ledger-lite 3/3
```

The two misses call for different fixes. A miss to a neighbour is a boundary to draw
between two descriptions, and the neighbour's may be the one to change; a miss to nothing
is a description that does not reach the request at all. Only the first skill a run loads
counts - it is the routing decision, and anything loaded later is the agent's choice about
its task. The same counts are stored per case as `went_to`.

The last line is the bill: how many agent runs the pass made, failed ones included,
and what they reported costing. If any run reported no cost, the total reads `n/a`
rather than a partial sum - not measured is not zero. `--compare` puts the pass cost
beside the other costs, and it is judged the same way: reported, not failed, unless
`--fail-on-cost`.

The runner splits the set **60/40 into train and validation**, stratified so both halves
carry positives and negatives, with a fixed seed so iterations compare like with like.

- Failures in the **train** set guide the next description.
- The **validation** numbers are the only thing that says the change generalised. Keep
  them out of the revision itself, or the split has bought nothing.

### Revising the description

- Positives failing means the description is too narrow: widen the scope, or say more
  about when the skill is useful.
- Negatives firing means it is too broad: add specificity, or draw the boundary against
  the adjacent capability.
- **Do not paste keywords from a failed query into the description.** That is the
  overfitting the split exists to expose. Find the category the failures represent and
  address that.
- Stuck after several passes? Try a structurally different description rather than more
  tweaks. And check the length: descriptions grow during optimisation and the limit is
  1024 characters.
- One rewrite from the false positives and negatives is usually most of the gain: a
  study of production descriptions found further iterations moved F1 by under half a
  point, inside its own noise (arXiv 2606.30775). If that rewrite does not help, the
  queries may be the problem - too easy, too hard, or mislabelled - or the two skills'
  scopes genuinely overlap, which the report flags as a train-validation gap.
- Run the neighbours as well: `--with-neighbours 2` puts the skills that share most words
  with this description into the same pass, and `--compare` shows whether the edit took
  their requests.
- **Pick the iteration with the best validation numbers, not the last one.** Later ones
  often overfit.

Then re-read [writing-rubric.md](writing-rubric.md) §1: a description that triggers well
can still be carrying restated identity and synonym triggers that cost context on every
turn.

## 2. Does it help

```
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --runtime
```

The agent in this pass runs with permission checks bypassed, so a skill that can reach the
network, spawn a process, run commands on load or hide what it runs is refused until
`--trust-target` says it is yours or has been read. Do not pass the flag for a skill you
have not read: the refusal names the findings, read those first.

The same task twice, and the difference is the whole point:

```
task
 ├── baseline   the agent with no skills at all      (claude --bare)
 └── treatment  the agent with this one skill loaded (--plugin-dir)
```

Isolation rests on two documented flags of the Claude Code CLI. `--bare` skips
auto-discovery of hooks, skills, commands, subagents, plugins and memory, which is what
makes a baseline a baseline: without it, the skill under test is installed on the
machine doing the measuring and **both** arms can reach it. `--plugin-dir` then loads
exactly one plugin, built from the skill under test and nothing else. A provider that
cannot do this says so in its report rather than calling the comparison a baseline.

### The task set

```json
{"skill_name": "ledger-lite",
 "evals": [{"id": "ledger-01",
            "prompt": "Log this receipt: 12.40 EUR at Bakery Nord on 2026-09-18",
            "expected_output": "a row appended to ledger.csv and the balance printed",
            "assertions": ["12.40", "re:balance", "not:could not"],
            "files": ["evals/files/ledger.csv"],
            "outputs": [{"path": "ledger.csv", "contains": ["Bakery Nord", "12.40"]}],
            "forbidden_tools": ["WebSearch"],
            "max_tool_calls": 6}]}
```

- an assertion is a **substring** by default, a **regex** behind `re:`, a **prohibition**
  behind `not:`;
- `outputs` names what the run must have created - the only assertion form that survives
  a model rewording its answer. A bare path checks that the file exists;
  `{"path", "contains"}` also reads it as UTF-8 text and applies the assertion grammar to
  what is inside, because an empty file exists just as well as the right one. Binary
  formats (`.xlsx`, `.pdf`, images) can only be checked by existence;
- `files` are **inputs**, as in skill-creator's format: paths inside the skill, copied
  into the run's working directory, which is fresh for every run. `fixtures` is the same
  thing under this suite's older name. An entry in `files` that is not a file in the
  skill is still graded as an output, the meaning it had here before, and `EV011` asks
  you to move it;
- `judge` is a program whose exit code grades the case, for correctness no substring can
  express - a total that has to add up, a file that has to parse. An argv list, never a
  shell line: `["{python}", "{skill}/evals/check.py", "{workdir}/totals.md"]`. It is the
  skill's own code, so a runtime pass runs it only under `--trust-target`;
- `forbidden_tools` and `max_tool_calls` are how "it worked" is told apart from "it
  worked eventually, after eleven tool calls and a web search".

A case with **no assertions and no outputs is ungraded**, and stays that way in the
report. Counting it as a pass would turn "nobody said what success is" into evidence of
success. skill-creator's `expectations` are graded by a model there and are not read here.

Write assertions **after** you have seen the first outputs: you rarely know what good
looks like before the skill has run. Good assertions are checkable; weak ones are vague
("the output is good") or brittle ("uses exactly the phrase ...").

### Reading the table

```
                           treatment    baseline       delta
  task success                  100%          0%       +100%
  tool calls                     1.5         0.5        +1.0
  tokens                      1960.0       815.0     +1145.0
  cost USD                    0.0340      0.0100     +0.0240
  safety violations                0           0           0
```

- `n/a` is not zero. A provider that did not report a token count reports `n/a`, and a
  comparison that invented a zero there would be quietly lying about cost.
- Assertions that pass in **both** columns measure nothing and inflate the score - cut
  or replace them. Assertions that fail in both are broken, or the case is too hard. The
  ones that pass only under `treatment` are where the skill's value is.
- **Safety violations** are the security module's own command patterns, applied to what
  the agent actually ran. A rule reported at rest and a rule reported in flight are the
  same rule, so the two lists cannot drift apart.
- Results that differ run to run mean the instructions are ambiguous, not that the model
  is moody. Raise `--runs`.

**If the agent handles the task well without the skill, the skill may not be adding
anything.** That is a real outcome and worth acting on.

## 3. Did the last edit make it worse

```
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --all --save v1
# ... edit the skill ...
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --all --save v2
sqs.py eval ./my-skill --compare v1 v2
```

```
REGRESSION DETECTED   v1 → v2

  ! task success          100% → 50%
  ! trigger precision     100% → 67%
  ! token usage           1960 → 2810   +43%

  tasks that got worse:
    ledger-02               100% → 0%

  trigger cases that flipped:
    [0.00 → 1.00] should no-trigger: Rename every receipt photo in this folder by date
```

Two kinds of worse, deliberately kept apart. **Quality** - task success, trigger
precision and recall - fails the gate. **Cost** - tokens, money, wall time, tool calls -
is reported and does not fail by default, because a skill that got 18% more expensive
and 20% more reliable is a trade somebody has to look at, not a build to break.
`--fail-on-cost` moves the line when a budget depends on it.

The thresholds are 5 points for a quality ratio and 15% for a cost one. Below that, the
model's own variance is louder than the change, and a gate that fires on variance gets
switched off.

Runs are stored in `.sqs/evals/<skill>/<label>.json` beside the skills, out of the skill
itself: an evaluation result is a measurement of a version, not a file that should ship
inside it.

## What the machine cannot grade

Assertions check what you thought to ask for. Read the outputs and the execution traces
yourself; the guidance names three signals worth more than any score:

- the agent tried several approaches before one worked → the instruction was vague;
- the agent followed an instruction that did not apply → the instruction is unscoped;
- the agent wrote the same helper script in every run → that script belongs in
  `scripts/`.

The third is the most valuable, and the cheapest to act on. Feed failures, complaints
and traces back into the skill, and **generalise the fixes**: a patch per failing case
is how a skill turns into sediment.

## Where the cases come from

Everything above needs a set that already exists: `--trigger` needs queries somebody wrote,
`--runtime` needs a task set somebody wrote, the gate needs two runs of that set. Writing the
set is the step people skip, and a stranger's skill arrives with none of it at all.

Skip it and two things go unnoticed, both expensive:

- **a skill that is intact, safe, well written and does not deliver.** Nothing about it looks
  broken, so nothing reports it. It holds a routing slot and costs context every turn for
  work it never actually does;
- **an improvement that is a downgrade.** Worse answers, or twice the wall time, or three
  times the tokens for the same result. The gate would catch all of those - it watches task
  success, trigger precision and recall, wall time, tokens, cost and tool calls - but only
  between two runs of a set that exists. Without one, the detector is you noticing months
  later, with the change that did it twenty commits back.

The set is what makes an improvement safe to attempt. That is the reason to spend the twenty
minutes below, not tidiness.

Three sources, and they answer different questions. Use all three on a skill you are adopting
and at least the first two on one you are writing. `sqs.py cases <skill> --generate` drafts
the set out of all three; reading the draft is the twenty minutes that makes the rest of the
page worth running.

**1. What you expect of it.** Write down, in plain sentences, what you want this skill to do
*for you*. Do it before you read the skill closely, and if the skill does not exist yet, do it
first - then it is an acceptance test instead of a description of whatever happened. This is
the only source that survives the skill being wrong about itself, and the only one that
answers "is this the skill I need", as opposed to "is this a good skill".

**2. Each improvement.** A capability the skill just gained is a thing no existing case
exercises. Write the case while you still remember what you changed and why, and keep it. This
is how a set accretes rather than standing still, and it is what stops the gate from comparing
two runs of a set frozen on day one: `--save` and `--compare` diff *the same set*, so over a
frozen one the gate reports no regression about behaviour it has never sampled.

**3. What a stranger's skill promises.** The description is a promise - *use me when X and I
will do Y*. `X` is the half `--trigger` tests; `Y` is tested by nothing. Read the description
and body and write the claims out as sentences you could be wrong about: *writes a `.csv`*,
*refuses when the folder is empty*, *never calls the network*, *its output carries a total*.
With no author to ask and no expectation written down, this is all you have.

Turn each sentence into a case with an **assertion, not a rubric**: `outputs`, `assertions`,
`forbidden_tools` and `max_tool_calls` in `evals.json` cover most of them deterministically,
and the judge is for what no assertion reaches. Then run it and read what had no evidence.

The three disagreeing is the useful part, and each disagreement means something different:

| expectation | promise | behaviour | what it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ | ✗ | - | wrong skill - it never claimed to do what you need |
| ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | broken skill, or a description that oversold |
| ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | fine skill, not for you |
| - | ✗ | ✓ | undeclared capability - it does something it never mentions |

That last row is not a bonus. A capability nobody agreed to is the same finding whether it is
useful or not, and the security pass is the other half of reading it. "Safe" and "works" are
different verdicts, and installing a stranger's skill on one of them is how you get the other
wrong - so run both in the same sitting.

## The Claude Code alternative

Claude Code ships its own eval runner, `claude plugin eval` (v2.1.269+). It answers the
same first two questions this page does, so check it before extending anything here.
It is **Claude Code only**: no other agent has it, which is why this suite keeps its own
harness-agnostic runner.

| | `claude plugin eval` | this suite |
|---|---|---|
| Unit under test | a plugin (needs `plugin.json`) | a skill directory |
| No-skill arm | built in, on by default; `--ablation none` turns it off | `--all`, two arms |
| Graders | `regex`, `tool_used`, `tool_order`, `file_exists`, `llm`, `baseline` | assertions plus a judge |
| Case authoring | `claude plugin eval init` interviews you and writes them | you write the YAML |
| Report | HTML plus `--json`, optionally published | terminal plus stored runs |
| Regression diff | not built in | `--compare`, `--fail-on-cost` |
| Agents supported | Claude Code | whatever the provider layer speaks |

Its case format is its own; it does not read the `evals/` layout above, and it is separate
again from the `evals/evals.json` that the `skill-creator` plugin uses. Three formats, no
conversion between them: pick one per skill rather than maintaining two.

Worth borrowing whatever you run: its documented first finding is a delta near zero with
the `tool_used: Skill` grader failing, which means the description is what needs the edit,
not the body. That is the same conclusion as [Revising the description](#revising-the-description).

## Testing the machinery without paying for it

```
SQS_FAKE_RUNS=script.json sqs.py eval ./my-skill --all --provider fake
```

The `fake` provider replays canned runs from a JSON script instead of calling a model.
It exists so the arithmetic on top of the runs - the confusion matrix, the two arms, the
regression diff - has tests that cost nothing; `tests/evaluation/` is that test. It
measures nothing about any skill, and every report it produces carries `fake` in the
provider line, so a scripted number can never be mistaken for a measured one.
